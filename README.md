## üéÆ Usage

### Starting the Application

The application provides a comprehensive GUI for configuration and monitoring:

1. **Camera Selection**: Choose from automatically detected cameras
2. **Performance Settings**: Adjust FPS, resolution, and frame skip
3. **Detection Configuration**: Customize danger zone areas
4. **Session Monitoring**: Track warnings and session time

### Performance Modes

| Mode         | Resolution | FPS | Frame Skip | Best For                           |
| ------------ | ---------- | --- | ---------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Low**      | 320x240    | 10  | 3          | Older hardware, integrated cameras |
| **Balanced** | 640x480    | 15  | 2          | Most systems, recommended default  |
| **High**     | 800x600    | 20  | 1          | Powerful systems, external cameras |

### Command Line Options

```bash
./run_trichshot.sh [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --rebuild              Force rebuild of Docker image
  --performance-mode     Set performance mode (low|balanced|high)
  --verbose              Enable verbose output and debugging
  --help                 Show help message and exit
```

### GUI Controls

- **Start/Stop Monitoring**: Begin or end the detection session
- **Camera Selection**: Switch between available cameras
- **Refresh Cameras**: Re-detect available cameras
- **Danger Zone Sliders**: Adjust the detection area
- **Performance Settings**: Modify FPS, resolution, and frame skip in real-time

## üîß Configuration

### Camera Setup

The application automatically detects and prioritizes cameras in this order:

1. **External USB cameras** (Logitech, Microsoft, Creative, etc.)
2. **Unknown cameras** with index > 0
3. **Integrated laptop cameras**

### Performance Tuning

For optimal performance, consider:

- **External cameras** generally perform better than integrated ones
- **Lower resolutions** (640x480) for older hardware
- **Higher frame skip values** (2-3) for CPU-constrained systems
- **Reduced FPS** (10-15) for smoother operation

### Danger Zone Configuration

- **Top Slider**: Adjusts the upper boundary of the detection zone
- **Bottom Slider**: Adjusts the lower boundary of the detection zone
- **Default**: Top 75% to bottom 75% of the screen (face area)

## üê≥ Docker Details

### Container Features

- **Lightweight**: Based on Python 3.10 slim image
- **Secure**: Runs as non-root user with minimal permissions
- **Optimized**: Pre-configured environment variables for performance
- **Smart**: Automatic camera device mapping and detection

### Environment Variables

The container supports several performance tuning variables:

```bash
OPENCV_LOG_LEVEL=ERROR                 # Reduce OpenCV logging
MEDIAPIPE_DISABLE_GPU=1               # Force CPU-only processing
OPENCV_VIDEOIO_PRIORITY_V4L2=1        # Prioritize V4L2 backend
OMP_NUM_THREADS=2                     # Limit OpenMP threads
PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1                    # Real-time Python output
```

### Resource Limits

Resource limits are automatically set based on performance mode:

- **Low**: 512MB RAM, 1 CPU core
- **Balanced**: 1GB RAM, 2 CPU cores
- **High**: 2GB RAM, 4 CPU cores

## üìä Performance Tips

### Hardware Recommendations

- **CPU**: Multi-core processor (2+ cores recommended)
- **RAM**: 1GB+ available memory
- **Camera**: External USB camera for best performance
- **OS**: Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) for optimal V4L2 support

### Troubleshooting Performance Issues

1. **Low FPS**: Reduce resolution or increase frame skip
2. **High CPU usage**: Lower FPS or enable more frame skipping
3. **Camera not detected**: Check permissions and V4L2 support
4. **Laggy GUI**: Try performance mode "low"

### Camera Compatibility

**Best Performance:**

- Logitech C920, C922, C930e
- Microsoft LifeCam series
- Creative Live! Cam series

**Good Performance:**

- Most USB webcams
- External cameras with V4L2 support

**Limited Performance:**

- Integrated laptop cameras
- Cameras without V4L2 drivers

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **Local Processing**: All detection happens locally, no data sent externally
- **No Recording**: Frames are processed in memory and not stored
- **Minimal Permissions**: Docker container runs with least-privilege access
- **Camera Access**: Only accesses cameras you explicitly grant access to

**Disclaimer**: TrichShot is a tool designed to assist with awareness of hand-to-face movements. It is not a medical device and should not replace professional medical advice or treatment. If you're struggling with trichotillomania or similar conditions, please consult with a healthcare professional.

Also, TrichShot was vibe-coded into existence. I'm putting this out there after I spent a few hours tweaking it. It has greatly minimized my compulsion to twist/pull while at the computer, and I'm already seeing positive results away from the computer. Hopefully this will be a positive reinforcement loop that can help me (and you!) to alleviate this impulse control disorder.
